Welcome to Rails TPL

This project aims to provide a simple starter project for web appilcations. This template project closely follows Michael Hartl's Rails Tutorial (see http://ruby.railstutorial.org/).
All the errors and mistakes in this project are of my doing and all the credits go to Michael.

What this project will provide when done:

* Easy starting point for more complex applications
* Using Bootstrap templates (see http://www.getbootstrap.com)
* Providing user management with sign-up/sign-in
* Later Sign-in via Twitter/Facebook/Google will be added
* Easy role management
* Deployment instructions for you to start using the template

Please add issues you find in the issues section of this github repository. There is no other website for this project.
